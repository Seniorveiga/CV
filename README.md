# Some of my data analyst projects

## [Project: Pens and Printers Data Analysis on Sales](https://github.com/Seniorveiga/Pens_and_printers/blob/main/Workspace/pens_and_printers_case_study.ipynb)

The company Pens And Printers had a problem with their customer focus, so I analyze the projects oriented to brainstorming.
* Data was taken from the "product_sales.csv" archive.
* It includes the whole cleaning process of the dataset, with imputation of NaN values, standarization  and data quality improvement.
* For the questions that they asked me to solve, I used visualization with Seaborn and MatPlotLib.
* With pandas I performed both the Exploratory Data Analysis and the import & cleaning data processes.
* I used hypothesis tests and ANOVA tests to determine the best way to deploy offers and product sales in the company.

## [Project: The hypothesis testing Bible](https://github.com/Seniorveiga/Python_Projects/tree/main/Hypothesis%20Testing%20Bible)

I have prepared this document in order to help my colleagues with the concept of *hypothesis testing* with some Notebooks. I already have studied this concept during my degree and I master it in my third year so I thought I could help them!
* It is divided in three notebooks that are classified as:
  1. Hypothesis testing fundamentals
  2. Proportion tests
  3. Non-Parametric tests
* It explains what is hypothesis testing based on the concept **ELI5** from **Reddit**. You can check more about it on [the following link](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/)
* It includes both the use in the mathematical way and in package way so itÂ´s easily understandable from both perspectives.
* Data was taken from the feather files *"dem_votes_potus_12_16.feather"* and *"late_shipments.feather"*. You can find more information about them in the notebook *"hypothesis_testing_Python.ipynb"*.
* The main packages used are:
  * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
  * [Pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/index.html)
  * [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
  * Other packages for imports or taking bootstrap samplings.
* The main test that you will learn in this packages are:
  * $\mathit{t}$-test.
  * Two-sample $\mathit{t}$-test.
  * $\mathit{z}$-Proportions test.
  * $\chi^{2}$ independence test.
  * $\chi^{2}$ goodness of fit test.
  * Wilcoxon test.
  * Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
  * Kruskal-Wallis test.
