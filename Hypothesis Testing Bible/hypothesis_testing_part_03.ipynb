    "There are certain asumptions that we do on our population that makes us use usual parametric tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "#### Randomness\n",
    "All hypothesis tests assume that they belong to a random sample. In case we donÂ´t confirm this hypothesis we cannot say that the sample is representative of the population. This should be reconsidered through the collection method of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need to ask to the source of the data to know the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Independence of observations\n",
    "We assume that each row is independent. If we donÂ´t consider the dependencies we would have more false positive / false negatives in our tests. Again, it should be checked in the collection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Large sample size\n",
    "If the sample is big enough we can apply the central limit theorem, this is that data can be paired with a normal distribution.\n",
    "If it is not applied what happens is that the tests that we perform on our data cannot conclude anything solid so it would again return lots of false positives and negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a general rule, we need **at least 30 observations** in our samples, unless we do it with two samples, that we wold need 30 in each one.\n",
    "- In case of proportion tests:\n",
    "    - If we do it with one sample, there should be **at least 10 failures and 10 successes**.\n",
    "    - If we do it with two samples, there should be **at least 10 failures and 10 successes in each samples**.\n",
